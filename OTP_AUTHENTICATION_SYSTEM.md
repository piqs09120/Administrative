# OTP Authentication System Documentation

## Overview
The OTP (One-Time Password) authentication system has been successfully implemented for the Soliera Hotel Administrative System. This system adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity with a 6-digit code sent to their email before they can access the system.

## Features

### ✅ Implemented Features
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Users must enter their credentials AND verify OTP
- **Email OTP Delivery**: 6-digit codes sent to user's registered email
- **10-minute Expiry**: OTP codes expire after 10 minutes for security
- **One-time Use**: Each OTP can only be used once
- **Resend Functionality**: Users can request new OTP codes
- **Auto-cleanup**: Expired OTPs are automatically cleaned up
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling during OTP verification
- **RBAC Integration**: Maintains existing role-based access control
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains intact

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- OTP Codes Table
CREATE TABLE otp_codes (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    otp_code VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    ip_address VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    
    INDEX idx_employee_otp (employee_id, otp_code),
    INDEX idx_expires_at (expires_at)
);
```

### File Structure
```
app/
├── Models/
│   └── OtpCode.php                    # OTP model with business logic
├── Notifications/
│   └── OtpCodeNotification.php       # Email notification for OTP
├── Http/Controllers/

└── verify-otp.blade.php              # OTP verification form

routes/web.php                        # OTP routes added
```

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Initial Login
```
User enters credentials → Validate credentials → Generate OTP → Send email → Redirect to OTP form
```

### 2. OTP Verification
```
User enters OTP → Validate OTP → Check expiry → Mark as used → Complete login → Redirect to dashboard
```

### 3. Failed Verification
```
Invalid/expired OTP → Show error → Allow retry → Option to resend OTP
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes
```php
// OTP Authentication Routes
Route::get('/verify-otp', [userController::class, 'showOtpForm'])->name('otp.verify');
Route::post('/verify-otp', [userController::class, 'verifyOtp'])->name('otp.verify.submit');
Route::post('/resend-otp', [userController::class, 'resendOtp'])->name('otp.resend');
```

### Controller Methods
```php
// userController methods
public function login(Request $request)           // Updated to send OTP
public function showOtpForm()                    // Display OTP form
public function verifyOtp(Request $request)      // Verify OTP code
public function resendOtp(Request $request)      // Resend OTP code
```

## Security Features

### 🔒 Security Measures
- **Time-based Expiry**: OTPs expire after 10 minutes
- **Single Use**: Each OTP can only be used once
- **IP Tracking**: User's IP address is logged with OTP
- **Session Validation**: OTP verification tied to specific session
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired OTPs are automatically removed
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against brute force

### 🛡️ Data Protection
- **No Plain Text Storage**: OTPs are stored securely
- **Session Security**: Proper session invalidation and regeneration
- **Email Security**: OTP codes sent via secure email channels
- **Audit Trail**: All OTP activities are logged

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Mail Configuration (required for OTP emails)
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@soliera.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Soliera Hotel"
```

### Scheduled Tasks
```php
// Automatic cleanup of expired OTPs (runs every hour)
$schedule->command('otp:cleanup')->hourly();
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Login**: Enter your Employee ID and password
2. **Check Email**: Look for OTP code in your email inbox
3. **Enter OTP**: Input the 6-digit code on the verification page
4. **Access System**: Once verified, you'll be logged into the system

### For Administrators
1. **Monitor OTPs**: Check `otp_codes` table for OTP activity
2. **Cleanup**: Run `php artisan otp:cleanup` to remove expired OTPs
3. **Test System**: Use `php artisan otp:test` to verify functionality

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test OTP system
php artisan otp:test

# Clean up expired OTPs
php artisan otp:cleanup
```

### Test Scenarios
- ✅ Valid credentials → OTP sent → Login successful
- ✅ Invalid credentials → Login rejected
- ✅ Valid OTP → Verification successful
- ✅ Invalid OTP → Verification failed
- ✅ Expired OTP → Verification failed
- ✅ Used OTP → Reuse blocked
- ✅ Email delivery → OTP received

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. OTP Not Received
- Check email spam folder
- Verify email configuration
- Check mail logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`

#### 2. OTP Verification Failed
- Ensure OTP is not expired (10 minutes)
- Check if OTP was already used
- Verify correct 6-digit code

#### 3. Session Issues
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check session configuration
- Restart application if needed

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check OTP table
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\OtpCode::all()

# Test email sending
php artisan tinker
>>> Mail::raw('Test email', function($msg) { $msg->to('test@example.com')->subject('Test'); });

# Check scheduled tasks
php artisan schedule:list
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor OTP Usage**: Check for unusual patterns
2. **Clean Logs**: Regular log rotation
3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep packages updated
4. **Backup Database**: Regular backups including OTP table

### Performance Optimization
- OTP table is indexed for fast lookups
- Expired OTPs are automatically cleaned up
- Email notifications are queued for better performance

## Integration Notes

### RBAC Compatibility
- ✅ All existing roles and permissions maintained
- ✅ User sessions work exactly as before
- ✅ Dashboard redirects based on user role
- ✅ Access control middleware unchanged

### Existing Functionality
- ✅ Visitor management system unaffected
- ✅ Document management system intact
- ✅ Legal management system preserved
- ✅ All other modules working normally

## Future Enhancements

- **TOTP Support**: Time-based OTP for mobile apps
- **Backup Codes**: Generate backup codes for recovery
- **Admin Override**: Allow admins to bypass OTP
- **Audit Dashboard**: OTP usage analytics
