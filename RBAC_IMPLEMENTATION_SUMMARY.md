# RBAC Implementation Summary

## Overview
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) has been successfully implemented for the web application using the existing `department_accounts` table. The system now provides role-based access control, dynamic sidebar rendering, and role-specific redirections after login.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Redirection After Login
- **Legal Officer** → redirects to Legal Management dashboard (`legal.case_deck`)
- **Receptionist** → redirects to Visitor Management dashboard (`visitor.index`)
- **Administrator / Super Admin** → redirects to Dashboard (`dashboard`)

### 2. Dynamic Sidebar Module Rendering
- **Legal Officer**: Sidebar shows only Dashboard and Legal Management
- **Receptionist**: Sidebar shows only Dashboard and Visitor Management  
- **Administrator / Super Admin**: Sidebar shows all modules

### 3. Access Restriction
- Users attempting to access restricted modules by URL are redirected to Dashboard with an error message
- Route protection using custom middleware

### 4. Scalable Structure
- Clean, modular RBAC logic allowing easy future expansion
- Centralized role definitions and permission logic

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `app/Http/Middleware/CheckUserRole.php` - Custom middleware for route protection
- `app/Services/RolePermissionService.php` - Service class for role management
- `RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php` - Added role-based redirection logic
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` - Registered the new middleware
- `resources/views/partials/sidebarr.blade.php` - Dynamic sidebar rendering
- `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` - Role information display
- `routes/web.php` - Applied role middleware to protected routes

## How It Works

### 1. Login Process
1. User enters credentials and receives OTP
2. After OTP verification, user role is fetched from `department_accounts` table
3. Role is stored in session for performance optimization
4. User is redirected based on their role

### 2. Sidebar Rendering
1. `RolePermissionService` determines accessible modules for current user
2. Sidebar conditionally renders only accessible modules
3. Each module section is wrapped with `@if(isset($sidebarModules['module_name']))`

### 3. Route Protection
1. Protected routes use `role` middleware
2. Middleware checks user's role against allowed roles for the route
3. Unauthorized access attempts redirect to dashboard with error message

## Role Definitions

```php
const ROLE_PERMISSIONS = [
    'Super Admin' => ['dashboard', 'legal', 'document', 'visitor', 'facilities', 'access'],
    'Administrator' => ['dashboard', 'legal', 'document', 'visitor', 'facilities', 'access'],
    'Legal Officer' => ['dashboard', 'legal'],
    'Receptionist' => ['dashboard', 'visitor']
];
```

## Middleware Usage

Routes are protected using the `role` middleware:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:Legal Officer,Administrator,Super Admin'])->group(function () {
    // Legal routes
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:Receptionist,Administrator,Super Admin'])->group(function () {
    // Visitor routes
});
```

## Session Management

- User role is stored in session after login: `Session::put('user_role', $user->role)`
- Reduces database queries for role checks
- Automatically refreshed when needed

## Future Expansion

To add new roles or modules:

1. **Add new role** to `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` constant in `RolePermissionService`
2. **Add new module** to existing roles as needed
3. **Protect new routes** using the `role` middleware
4. **Update sidebar** to include new module sections

## Testing

The system can be tested by:
1. Logging in with different role accounts
2. Verifying correct redirection after login
3. Checking sidebar shows only accessible modules
4. Attempting to access restricted routes (should redirect to dashboard)

## Notes

- **No existing business logic was modified** - only extended with access control
- **Login page (`project.test/login`) remains unchanged** as requested
- **Session-based role checking** provides optimal performance
- **Clean separation of concerns** between middleware, service, and views
